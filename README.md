# Artificial Intelligence Engineer & Machine Learning Engineer

## About Me
An innovative and self-motivated professional who recently completed a **Postgraduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Moratuwa**. I possess strong knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, data science, statistics, and mathematical concepts. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of Python programming, AI/ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and SQL. I am skilled in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and developing predictive models.

I am passionate about data-driven decision-making and am seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience and drive innovation through machine learning. I am eager to apply my skills in real-world applications and am looking to contribute my technical, problem-solving, and analytical skills, as well as my past work experience, to a data science team.

### [Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

-  Designed and developed a machine learning application for airlines to make proactive decisions by implementing 
a prediction model to classify flight delays.
-  The model was built using **Python, Pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.** A support-vector machine 
(SVM) was used as the machine learning model.
-  The application was developed for the Applied Machine Learning module in the Postgraduate Diploma in AI.

#### Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
